# timeline2map
Map Google Timeline exported data (json) to map

1. Export from your phone the location timeline (> settings > location > location services > timeline > export timeline date)
2. You should get a file named location-history.json
3. Put the map.py file into the same folder as the json file and just run it with "python map.py"
4. If all went to plan, you should have a file called "location_history_map.html" in the same folder now
5. Just open it in your browser of choice and let me know what you think.

Probably you need to install the module "geopy" with "pip install geopy" if you haven't done so already. 

Looking forward to your feedbacks.
